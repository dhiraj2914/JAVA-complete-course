## üìù My Learning Notes

### Key Java Concepts to Remember
- **Variables**: Use descriptive names (camelCase)
- **Methods**: Break code into reusable functions
- **OOP**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- **Error Handling**: Always validate user input
- **Code Style**: Consistent formatting and comments

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting semicolons
- Mixing up single quotes (char) vs double quotes (String)
- Integer division losing decimal precision
- Not closing Scanner objects
- Confusion between `=` (assignment) and `==` (comparison)

### Shortcuts I've Learned
- `sout` + Tab ‚Üí `System.out.println()`
- Ctrl+Alt+L ‚Üí Format code
- `++variable` vs `variable++` (pre vs post increment)
